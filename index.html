                        Hello! I am currently a full stack software engineer at Workiva. Outside of school, I enjoy pottery, logic puzzles, and chess. Additonally, I am a huge fan of basketball, soccer, and Forumla 1 racing. My favorite teams are the Golden State Warriors for basketball, and the Netherlands National team, Ajax of Amsterdam, and Liverpool for soccer.

                        As a software engineering intern at Workiva, I have been working with the Evidence Lifecycle team, within the greater Integrated Risk Team. 
                        Throughout the summer I experienced different meetings akin to the agile methodology and tackled numerous and increasingly challenging tickets, all a part of the software development cycle.
                        Additionally, looking towards the final semester of my undergraduate degree, I will remain working with Workiva to continue to improve upon soft and technical skills.

                    <p style="color:White;">
                        One of my main projects was a code consolidation and refactor for two different services, to unify and make the two services consistent. 
                        Pairing with a senior developer, the refactor consisted of updating the file storage database, consuming an existing pdf renderer interop layer, and re-introducing lost functionality. 
                        Other focuses of work were permissions debugging and patches, implementing back-end endpoints for cross service communication, and implementing server messaging fallbacks.

                        During the summer of 2020, I was fortunate to intern as a software engineer at Visa.
                        Working from home due to Covid-19, the internship consisted of self paced online learning, a multitude of video presentations, and lastly meetings with my mentor and software team.
                        It was a great experience to learn and improve on technical skills, while also getting the chance to practice effective communication with team members.

                    <p style="color:White;">
                        The other large part of the internship was an intern wide software development project.
                        See Pyggy Bank below for project details.
                        Beyond just coding and constructing the project, our team practiced the Agile development methodology with daily scrum meetings.
                        It forced our team (across the US and UK) to communicate proactively and efficiently in order to meet the designated deadline.

                        Over the course of my junior year, I was able to complete my senior capstone project, partnering with 5 other peers and the medical hardware company, Terumo BCT. 
                        We took on the responsibility of coordinating with our sponsor for requirements and deliverables, along with group coordination, weekly meetings, and work sessions. 
                        Our objective was to identify trends leading to device failure by implementing learning algorithms and researching preventative maintenance.

                        Our team pulled data from a SQL server, ported the data into dataframes, to then apply machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. 
                        We utilized the k-means algorithm, different regression models, TensorFlow networks, and more. 
                        Finally, we summarized our team’s findings in a research document, detailing what we identified, while also providing strategies and methods for future investigation.

                        Pyggy Bank was an IOS/Android app (developed using Flutter), created during a software development competition during my time as a Visa software engineering intern.
                        Along with 5 other teammates, we created an app to effectively share and pool money.
                        During the creation process, our team practiced the Agile methodology with daily scrum meetings.

                        Our team used Google Firebase to create a working NoSQL database to store user data.
                        Additionally, the app used both QR codes for group sharing and a chat function to go along with the transactions.
                        In order to process payments we had access to Visa's APIs, specifically Visa Direct(Push/Pull).

                        Ski Base was a project website for my Software Development & Tools class, which I took during my second semester of my freshman year.
                        Attending school in Colorado, my group decided to make a website to track how much a user has skied or snowboarded on the most popular mountains.

                    <p style="color:White;">
                        This website had a range of different mountains and a tally for each one, showing how many times the user had skied on that mountain.
                        Additionally, when hovering over the mountain, my group installed a weather api to show the temperature, wind, and snowfall on the mountain.
                        This project honed my skills in css/html, javascript (Node.js), and SQL (PostrgeSQL).
