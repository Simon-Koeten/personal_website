                        Hello! I am currently a full stack software engineer at Workiva. Outside of work, I enjoy pottery, logic puzzles, and chess. Additonally, I am a huge fan of basketball, soccer, and Formula 1 racing. My favorite teams are the Golden State Warriors for basketball, and the Netherlands National team, Ajax of Amsterdam, and Liverpool for soccer.

                        Starting out as a software engineering intern at Workiva in May of 2021, I was brought on as a full time engineer in February of 2022. I am a full stack engineer: familiar with Dart in the frontend, Java/Kotlin in the backend, and MySQL for databases. I also have strong experience working with AWS (specifically cloudformation), Docker, and Kubernetes. I have had the fortune to be able to do research into new technologies and novel architectures, taking the discovery work and converting it into an implemented solution.

                    <p style="color:White;">
                        The skills and knowledge gained have come from numerous different projects, ranging from creating and supporting a slack notification service to working on and owning a control management service along with one of its consumers. Further, I have had great experience leading different projects. They consist of a migration to a custom written cloudformation template, migrating service builds from custom build tools to github actions, and finally a full service/api overhaul and refactor aimed at generalizing the service.

                        During the summer of 2020, I was fortunate to intern as a software engineer at Visa.
                        Working from home due to Covid-19, the internship consisted of self paced online learning, a multitude of video presentations, and lastly meetings with my mentor and software team.
                        It was a great experience to learn and improve on technical skills, while also getting the chance to practice effective communication with team members.

                    <p style="color:White;">
                        The other large part of the internship was an intern wide software development project.
                        See Pyggy Bank below for project details.
                        Beyond just coding and constructing the project, our team practiced the Agile development methodology with daily scrum meetings.
                        It forced our team (across the US and UK) to communicate proactively and efficiently in order to meet the designated deadline.

                        Over the course of my junior year, I was able to complete my senior capstone project, partnering with 5 other peers and the medical hardware company, Terumo BCT. 
                        We took on the responsibility of coordinating with our sponsor for requirements and deliverables, along with group coordination, weekly meetings, and work sessions. 
                        Our objective was to identify trends leading to device failure by implementing learning algorithms and researching preventative maintenance.

                        Our team pulled data from a SQL server, ported the data into dataframes, to then apply machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. 
                        We utilized the k-means algorithm, different regression models, TensorFlow networks, and more. 
                        Finally, we summarized our teamâ€™s findings in a research document, detailing what we identified, while also providing strategies and methods for future investigation.

                        Pyggy Bank was an IOS/Android app (developed using Flutter), created during a software development competition during my time as a Visa software engineering intern.
                        Along with 5 other teammates, we created an app to effectively share and pool money.
                        During the creation process, our team practiced the Agile methodology with daily scrum meetings.

                        Our team used Google Firebase to create a working NoSQL database to store user data.
                        Additionally, the app used both QR codes for group sharing and a chat function to go along with the transactions.
                        In order to process payments we had access to Visa's APIs, specifically Visa Direct(Push/Pull).

                        Ski Base was a project website for my Software Development & Tools class, which I took during my second semester of my freshman year.
                        Attending school in Colorado, my group decided to make a website to track how much a user has skied or snowboarded on the most popular mountains.

                <div class="six columns" >
                    <p style="color:White;">
                        This website had a range of different mountains and a tally for each one, showing how many times the user had skied on that mountain.
                        Additionally, when hovering over the mountain, my group installed a weather api to show the temperature, wind, and snowfall on the mountain.
                        This project honed my skills in css/html, javascript (Node.js), and SQL (PostrgeSQL).
